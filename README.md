## Supported Offline Payment Methods

Magento 2 offline methods are Check / Money order, Bank transfer, Cash on delivery and Purchase order. All methods are now supported.

However, if you use the branch [hyva-checkout-example-template](https://github.com/hyva-themes/magento2-react-checkout-offline-payments/tree/hyva-checkout-example-template), then it only supports purchase order method at the moment. Rest of the methods needs to be modified to make it work with the example-template module.
